<Center><font size=5><b>Chess Rules</b></font></center>
<br>

<P>Chess is a game, played by two players. One player plays with the white
pieces, and the other player plays with the black pieces. Each player has
sixteen pieces in the beginning of the game: one king, one queen, two rooks,
two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. </P>

<P>The game is played on a chessboard, consisting of 64 squares: eight
rows and eight columns. The squares are alternately light (white) and dark
colored. The board must be laid down such that there is a black square
in the lower-left corner. To facilitate notation of moves, all squares
are given a name. From the view of the white player, the rows are numbered
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8; the lowest row has number 1, and the upper row
has number 8. The columns are named, from left to right, a, b, c, d, e,
f, g, h. A square gets a name, consisting of the combination of its column-letter
and row-number, e.g., the square in the lower left corner (for white) is
a1. </P>

<P>Alternately, the players make a move, starting with the white player
(the player that plays with the white pieces.) A move consists of moving
one of the pieces of the player to a different square, following the rules
of movement for that piece - there is one special exception, named <B>castling</B>,
where players move two pieces simultaneously. </P>

<P>A player can <B>take</B> a piece of the opponent by moving one of his
own pieces to the square that contains a piece of the opponent. The opponents
piece then is removed from the board, and out of play for the rest of the
game. (Taking is not compulsory.) </P>

<P>At the start of the game, the position of the pieces is as follows.

</P>

<P>Thus, at the second row, there are eight white pawns, at the seventh
row, there are eight black pawns. At the first row, from left to right,
we have a: rook, knight, bishop, queen, king, bishop, knight, and rook.
Note that the queens start of squares of their own color, with a dark square
in each players left hand corner.
</P>

<H2>Movement of the pieces</H2>

<a name="rook"> </a>

<H3>Rook</H3>

<P>The rook moves in a straight line, horizontally or vertically. The rook
may not jump over other pieces, that is: all squares between the square
where the rook starts its move and where the rook ends its move must be
empty. (As for all pieces, when the square where the rook ends his move
contains a piece of the opponent, then this piece is taken. The square
where the rook ends his move may not contain a piece of the player owning
this rook.) </P>

<a name="bishop"> </a>

<H3>Bishop</H3>

<P>The bishop moves in a straight diagonal line. The bishop may also not
jump over other pieces. </P>

<a name="queen"> </a>

<H3>Queen</H3>

<P>The queen has the <I>combined</I> moves of the rook and the bishop,
i.e., the queen may move in any straight line, horizontal, vertical, or
diagonal. </P>

<a name="knight"> </a>

<H3>Knight</H3>

<P>The knight makes a move that consists of first one step in a horizontal
or vertical direction, and then one step diagonally in an outward direction. The knight <I>jumps</I>:
it is allowed that the first square that the knight passes over is occupied
by an arbitrary piece. For instance, white can start the game by moving
his knight from b1 to c3. The piece that is jumped over is further not
affected by the knight: as usual, a knight takes a piece of the opponent
by moving to the square that contains that piece. </P>

<a name="pawn"> </a>

<H3>Pawn</H3>

<P>The pawn moves differently regarding whether it moves to an empty square
or whether it takes a piece of the opponent. When a pawn does not take,
it moves one square straight forward. When this pawn has not moved at all,
i.e., the pawn is still at the second row (from the owning players view),
the pawn may make a double step straight forward. For instance, a white
pawn on d2 can be moved to d4. </P>

<P>When taking, the pawn goes one square diagonally forward. </P>

<P>There is one special rule, called <I>taking en-passant</I>. 
When a pawn makes a double step from the second row to the fourth row, and there is an enemy pawn on an 
adjacent square on the fourth row, then this enemy pawn inthe next move may move diagonally to the square 
that was passed over by the double-stepping pawn, which is on the third row. In this same move, the 
double-stepping pawn is taken. 

<!-- 
When a pawn
makes a double step from the second row to the fourth row, and there is
an enemy pawn on an adjacent square on the fourth row, then this enemy
pawn may move to the square on the third row that was passed over, and
taking the other pawn. 
 -->

This taking en-passant must be done directly: if
the player who could take en-passant does not do this in the first move
after the double step, this pawn cannot be taken anymore by an en-passant
move. </P>

<P>Pawns that reach the last row of the board <I>promote.</I> When a player
moves a pawn to the last row of the board, he replaces the pawn by a queen,
rook, knight, or bishop (of the same color). Usually, players will promote
the pawn to a queen, but the other types of pieces are also allowed. (It
is not required that the pawn is promoted to a piece taken. Thus, it is
for instance possible that a player has at a certain moment two queens.)</P>

<<a name="king"> </a>

<H3>King</H3>

<P>The king moves one square in any direction, horizontally, vertically,
or diagonally. There is one special type of move, made by a king and rook
simultaneously, called <I>castling</I>: see below. </P>

<P>The king is the most important piece of the game, and moves must be
made in such a way that the king is never in check: see below.
</P>

<H3>Castling</H3>

<P>Under certain, special rules, a king and rook can move simultaneously
in a <I>castling</I> move. </P>

<P>The following conditions must be met: </P>

<UL>
<LI>The king that makes the castling move has not yet moved in the game.

</LI>

<LI>The rook that makes the castling move has not yet moved in the game.
</LI>

<LI>The king is not in check. </LI>

<LI>The king does not move over a square that is attacked by an enemy piece
during the castling move, i.e., when castling, there may not be an enemy piece
that can move (in case of pawns: by diagonal movement) to a square that is
moved over by the king. </LI>

<LI>The king does not move to a square that is attacked by an enemy piece
during the castling move, i.e., you may not castle and end the move with the
king in check. </LI>

<LI>All squares between the rook and king before the castling move are
empty. </LI>

<LI>The King and rook must occupy the same rank (or row).</LI>

</UL>

<P>When castling, the king moves two squares towards the rook, and the
rook moves over the king to the next square, i.e., black's king on e8 and
rook on a8 move to: king c8, rook d8 (<I>long castling</I>), white's king
on e1 and rook on h1 move to: king g1, rook f1 (<I>short castling</I>).
</P>

<H2>Check, mate, and stalemate</H2>

<H3>Check</H3>

<P>When the king of a player can be taken by a piece of the opponent, one
says that the king is <I>in check</I>. For instance, the white player moves
his rook to a position such that it attacks the black king, i.e., if black
doesn't do anything about it, the rook could take the black king in the
next move: we say that the white rook <I>gives check.</I> It is considered
good manners to say <I>check</I> when one checks ones opponent. </P>

<P>It is not allowed to make a move, such that ones king is in check after
the move. If a player accidently tries to make such a move, he must take the
move back and make another move (following the rules that one must move with
the piece one has touched.)</P>

<H3>Mate</H3>

<P>When a player is in check, and he cannot make a move such that after
the move, the king is not in check, then he is <I>mated</I>. The player
that is mated lost the game, and the player that mated him won the game.
</P>

<P>Note that there are three different possible ways to remove a check:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Move the king away to a square where he is not in check. </LI>

<LI>Take the piece that gives the check. </LI>

<LI>(In case of a check, given by a rook, bishop or queen: ) move a piece
between the checking piece and the king. </LI>
</OL>

<H3>Stalemate</H3>

<P>When a player cannot make any legal move, but he is not in check, then
the player is said to be <I>stalemated</I>. In a case of a stalemate, the
game is a draw. </P>
