## Chess 
### Description

May 2006

This was one of my earlier creations. This program has complete 2 player mode with move aids, check notifications, and check mate notification. Games can be saved and loaded at a later time like they never stopped, and moves can even be un-done all the way back to the beginning of the game. I did write a minimal A.I. system to show some of the multithreaded capacities of this program, but it was purposely left very minimal and containing a few bugs. I am sure that I could remove the bugs and drastically improve the A.I. capabilities with out too much modification, but I instead chose to leave this program at a completely functional yet still slightly incomplete state to show what I can accomplish in a limited time span.

This was my first major project using a multithreaded approach, and was also the first project of mine that incorporated my own on the fly debugging. Using a command window that I wrote I can change almost any variable or even execute custom scripts specific for this program. Also included with the console window I wrote, there is also a complete informational window that I created to show all variable values, complete array contents, or even just regular processing data. A small demonstration of the open ended possibilities with the interface a designed is available by running any of the demos in the Demos menu.

You can access chess console by prssing CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+~. You can access the chess info window by pressing CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+I to access the info window which has more help and some console documentation.
